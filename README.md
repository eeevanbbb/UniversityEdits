# UniversityEdits
[@UniversityEdits](https://twitter.com/UniversityEdits) is a Twitter bot that automatically tweets whenever someone from a university campus anonymously edits the Wikipedia page of another (or their own) university.

---

The list of monitored Wikipedia pages can be found in [MonitoredPages.txt](https://github.com/eeevanbbb/UniversityEdits/blob/master/Monitored_Pages). The list of monitored IP ranges (and their corresponding institutions) can be found in [IP_Ranges.txt](https://github.com/eeevanbbb/UniversityEdits/blob/master/IP_Ranges.txt). To add schools to either list, send a pull request, or tweet @UniversityEdits. If you don't know the IP ranges allocated for your school, don't worry! Just tweet @UniversityEdits and I can look it up.
